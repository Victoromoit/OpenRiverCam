Welcome to OpenRiverCam documentation and tutorials
===================================================

OpenRiverCam is a fully web-based solution for setting up maintaining river observation sites for river flow
monitoring with cameras. The software's backend is based on Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV), and
geographical orthprojection methods. With affordable camera equipment and a single field survey, you can start
monitoring river flows. Software can be deployed locally or on your home server, or be used through deployment in the
cloud. Its user-friendly web interface can be accessed via smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop, all in a simple
browser. We highly recommend to do the :ref:`Quick start<tutorial>`. to find out if OpenRiverCam will fulfill your
needs.
